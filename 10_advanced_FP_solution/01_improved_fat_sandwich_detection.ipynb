# Advanced False Positive Solution: Improved Fat Sandwich Detection

## Overview
This notebook implements an advanced solution to fix the severe false positive problem in fat sandwich detection.

### Problem Addressed
- **Original Issue**: 367,162 detections with many false positives (5.5-hour "sandwiches")
- **Root Cause**: No time window constraints, unlimited time spans
- **Solution**: True rolling time windows with millisecond precision

## Key Improvements
1. **Rolling time windows** (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s) - not unlimited time spans
2. **Millisecond-precise timing** - uses `ms_time` instead of slot count  
3. **Multiple validation checks** - A-B-A pattern, victim ratio, token pairs
4. **Confidence scoring** - distinguishes high vs low quality detections

## Expected Results
- Reduce ~370k detections to ~50k-80k (70-80% reduction)
- Maximum time span: <10 seconds (was: 5.5 hours!)
- False positive rate reduction: ~80%
