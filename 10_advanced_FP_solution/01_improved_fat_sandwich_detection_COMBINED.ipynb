# Advanced False Positive Solution: Improved Fat Sandwich Detection

## 📋 Overview

This notebook implements and demonstrates the advanced solution to fix the severe false positive problem in fat sandwich detection. The original method detected 367,162 "sandwiches" including 5.5-hour patterns which were actually just long-term trading sequences, not coordinated attacks.

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **True rolling time windows (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s)** - not unlimited time spans
2. **Millisecond-precision timing** using `ms_time` instead of slot count
3. **Multiple validation checks** (A-B-A pattern, victim ratio, token pairs)
4. **Confidence scoring** to distinguish high vs low quality detections

## 🎯 Expected Results

- Reduce ~370k detections to ~50k-80k (70-80% reduction)
- Maximum time span: <10 seconds (was: 5.5 hours!)
- False positive rate reduction: ~80%
