rank,variable,importance,score,usage,details
1,signer,CRITICAL,10.0,Identifies MEV attackers across all detection methods,Sandwich: Groups trades by signer to find attackers with ≥2 tx in slot; Front-run: Filters to top MEV attackers by signer; Back-run: Filters to top MEV attackers by signer; Fat sandwich: Validates same signer at start and end of slot
2,slot,CRITICAL,10.0,Groups trades temporally for sandwich detection,Sandwich: Groups trades in same slot to detect front-run → victim → back-run; Front-run: Identifies late-slot trades (>300ms); Back-run: Links trades to oracle updates in same slot; Fat sandwich: Requires ≥5 trades in same slot
3,from_token/to_token,CRITICAL,9.5,Validates sandwich attacks are on same token pair (same pool),Prevents false positives from aggregator routing across different pools; Ensures front-run and back-run are on same trading pair; Helps distinguish true MEV from multi-pool aggregator bundles; Used in 0 sandwich detections
4,ms_time,CRITICAL,9.0,Validates timing patterns for MEV attacks,Sandwich: Validates attacker trades span ≥30% of slot duration; Back-run: Requires <50ms response time after oracle update; Front-run: Identifies late-slot trades (>300ms delay); Time span ratio: Key metric for high-confidence MEV (span >50% = high confidence)
5,time_diff_ms,HIGH,8.0,Detects back-running after oracle updates,"Back-run: Requires <50ms between oracle update and trade; Indicates automated bot response to oracle price changes; Key metric for distinguishing MEV from normal trading; Threshold: <50ms = suspicious, <30ms = highly suspicious"
6,validator,HIGH,7.5,Attribution and validator-level MEV analysis,Identifies which validators process MEV attacks; Enables validator-level clustering and analysis; Helps identify validator-MEV bot relationships; Used in per-validator MEV statistics
7,amm_trade,HIGH,7.0,Identifies which pAMM protocols are targeted,"Groups MEV attacks by protocol (ZeroFi, HumidiFi, etc.); Enables per-protocol MEV statistics; Helps identify protocol-specific attack patterns; Used in per-pAMM top 10 attacker analysis"
8,us_since_first_shred,MEDIUM-HIGH,7.0,Detects late-slot trades (front-running),"Front-run: Requires >300ms delay (300,000 microseconds); Indicates strategic placement late in slot; Suggests mempool monitoring and insertion; Threshold: >300ms = suspicious front-running"
9,prev_kind,MEDIUM,6.5,Links trades to preceding oracle updates,"Back-run: Requires prev_kind == ""ORACLE""; Validates trade immediately follows price update; Key for detecting oracle exploitation; Used in conjunction with time_diff_ms"
10,time_span_ratio,MEDIUM,6.5,Confidence scoring for sandwich attacks,Calculated as: (attacker_max_time - attacker_min_time) / slot_duration; High confidence: >50% span AND ≥2 victims; Medium confidence: 30-50% span OR 1 victim; Validates attacker trades span significant portion of slot
11,aggregator_ratio,MEDIUM,6.0,Filters out Jupiter aggregator routing (false positives),Calculated as: unique_signers / trade_count; If >0.7 and attacker has <30% of trades → likely aggregator; Prevents false positives from legitimate aggregator routing; Key for distinguishing MEV from aggregator bundles
12,victims_count,MEDIUM,6.0,Confidence scoring and fat sandwich validation,High confidence: ≥2 victims between attacker trades; Validates true sandwich pattern (victims between front-run and back-run); Fat sandwich: Multiple victims in same slot; Key for distinguishing MEV from failed attempts
